Its goal is to identify similar or identical **user requests**. When a matching request is found, the corresponding information is retrieved from the cache, reducing the need to query the original source. A RAG system without a semantic cache quickly becomes insufficient in **production** environments, where it may encounter tens to thousands of recurring requests. One way to improve performance is by introducing **one or multiple semantic caches**.\n\nBecause the comparison is based on **semantic meaning**, requests may be phrased differently while still referring to the same information need. Although the model’s final response may vary depending on the wording of the request, the information retrieved from the vector database should remain the same. Therefore, the cache system is positioned **between** the **user** and the **vector database**, rather than between the user and the LLM.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a RAG system, there are **two main time-consuming** steps:\n1. Retrieving the information used to construct the enriched prompt.\n2. Calling the large language model to generate the response.\nA semantic cache can be introduced at either of these points, and in some cases, two separate caches may be used—one for each step.\n\nPlacing the cache at the model-response stage may lead to a loss  of influence over the obtained response. If the cache stores model responses, users may perceive that their instructions are not being followed accurately. In contrast, similar user requests typically require the same information to enrich the prompt. For this reason, in the current notebook, the semantic cache is positioned between the user’s request and the retrieval of information from the vector database.\n\nThis is a **design decision**. Depending on the nature of the requests and the desired behavior of the system, the cache can be placed at **different points in the pipeline**. While caching model responses can offer the greatest performance gains, it comes at the cost of losing user influence over the response.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

It is always better to prevent a disease than to treat it after it occurs. Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), mumps, tetanus, rotavirus and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) can now be prevented by vaccination. Thanks to a vaccine, one of the most terrible diseases in history – smallpox – no longer exists outside the laboratory. Over the years vaccines have prevented countless cases of disease and saved millions of lives. Immunity Protects us From Disease Immunity is the body’s way of preventing disease.  Children are born with an immune system composed of cells, glands, organs, and fluids located throughout the body. The immune system recognizes germs that enter the body as \"foreign invaders” (called antigens) and produces proteins called antibodies to fight them. The first time a child is infected with a specific antigen (say measles virus), the immune system produces antibodies designed to fight it. This takes time . . . usually the immune system can’t work fast enough to prevent the antigen from causing disease, so the child still gets sick.  However, the immune system “remembers” that antigen. If it ever enters the body again, even after many years, the immune system can produce antibodies fast enough to keep it from causing disease a second time. This protection is called immunity. It would be nice if there were a way to give children immunity to a disease without their having to get sick first. In fact there is: Vaccines contain the same antigens (or parts of antigens) that cause diseases. For example, measles vaccine contains measles virus. But the antigens in vaccines are either killed, or weakened to the point that they don’t cause disease. However, they are strong enough to make the immune system produce antibodies that lead to immunity. In other words, a vaccine is a safer substitute for a child’s first exposure to a disease. The child gets protection without having to get sick. Through vaccination, children can develop immunity without suffering from the actual diseases that vaccines prevent. Top of Page More Facts Newborn babies are immune to many diseases because they have antibodies they got from their mothers. However, this immunity goes away during the first year of life. If an unvaccinated child is exposed to a disease germ, the child's body may not be strong enough to fight the disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are protected by vaccines, we don’t see these diseases nearly as often. Immunizing individual children also helps to protect the health of our community, especially those people who cannot be immunized (children who are too young to be vaccinated, or those who can’t receive certain vaccines for medical reasons), and the small proportion of people who don’t respond to a particular vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases have a costly impact, resulting in doctor's visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. Sick children can also cause parents to lose time from work.

They are characterized by episodes in which the affected muscles become slack, weak, and unable to contract. Between attacks, the affected muscles usually work as normal.\\n                \\nThe two most common types of periodic paralyses are: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis is characterized by a fall in potassium levels in the blood. In individuals with this mutation attacks often begin in adolescence and are triggered by strenuous exercise, high carbohydrate meals, or by injection of insulin, glucose, or epinephrine. Weakness may be mild and limited to certain muscle groups, or more severe and affect the arms and legs. Attacks may last for a few hours or persist for several days. Some patients may develop chronic muscle weakness later in life. Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is characterized by a rise in potassium levels in the blood. Attacks often begin in infancy or early childhood and are precipitated by rest after exercise or by fasting. Attacks are usually shorter, more frequent, and less severe than the hypokalemic form. Muscle spasms are common.\\n\\n The user's question: Write in 20 words what is a periodic paralyses\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-23T17:54:05.875070Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-23T17:54:05.875344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.588686Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-23T17:54:05.875311Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.587777Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors=\"pt\").to(\"cuda\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.589714Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.590070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.602767Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.590032Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-23T17:54:19.602119Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Takeaways\n\nThe performance improvement is approximately 50% when accessing the cache directly compared to querying ChromaDB. In this setup, the amount of **data stored** in ChromaDB is **small**, and only a **single instance** of the **cache class** is used. \n\nIn larger projects, this difference typically increases, leading to improvements of around 90–95%. In real-world systems, the data behind the cache is usually **much larger** and may involve retrieving information from **multiple sources**, not just a vector database.
